## Overview

The provided code implements a signature forgery detection system using a neural network. The system processes signature images, extracts various features from them, and then trains a neural network to distinguish between genuine and forged signatures. The features include ratio, centroid, eccentricity, solidity, skewness, and kurtosis.

## Code Structure

### Libraries Used
- `numpy`: For numerical operations.
- `os`: For interacting with the operating system (file paths, folder creation).
- `matplotlib`: For image visualization.
- `scipy.ndimage`: For image processing operations.
- `skimage.measure.regionprops`: For extracting region properties from binary images.
- `skimage.io`: For reading images.
- `skimage.filters.threshold_otsu`: For thresholding images.
- `tensorflow`: For creating and training neural networks.
- `pandas`: For handling CSV files.

### Functions

1. **`rgbgrey(img)`**
   - Converts RGB images to grayscale.
   
2. **`greybin(img)`**
   - Converts grayscale images to binary using Otsu's thresholding.
   
3. **`preproc(path, img=None, display=True)`**
   - Preprocesses the signature image by converting it to grayscale, binary, and extracting the signature part using a bounding box.
   
4. **`Ratio(img)`**
   - Computes the ratio of white pixels to the total number of pixels in the binary image.
   
5. **`Centroid(img)`**
   - Computes the centroid (center of mass) of the white pixels in the binary image.
   
6. **`EccentricitySolidity(img)`**
   - Computes the eccentricity and solidity of the signature using region properties.
   
7. **`SkewKurtosis(img)`**
   - Computes the skewness and kurtosis of the signature.
   
8. **`getFeatures(path, img=None, display=False)`**
   - Extracts various features from the signature image using the above functions.
   
9. **`getCSVFeatures(path, img=None, display=False)`**
   - Extracts features and formats them for saving to a CSV file.
   
10. **`makeCSV()`**
    - Creates CSV files for training and testing data, containing features and corresponding labels (genuine or forged).
    
11. **`testing(path)`**
    - Creates a CSV file for a test image containing its features.
    
12. **`readCSV(train_path, test_path, type2=False)`**
    - Reads data from CSV files, returning training and testing data.
    
13. **`multilayer_perceptron(x)`**
    - Defines the structure of the neural network model.
    
14. **`evaluate(train_path, test_path, type2=False)`**
    - Trains the neural network and evaluates its performance on training and testing data.
    
15. **`trainAndTest(rate=0.001, epochs=1700, neurons=7, display=False)`**
    - Trains and tests the model with specified hyperparameters and returns average accuracy.

## Workflow

1. **Image Preprocessing:**
   - Convert RGB image to grayscale.
   - Convert grayscale image to binary using Otsu's thresholding.
   - Extract the signature part using a bounding box.

2. **Feature Extraction:**
   - Extract various features such as ratio, centroid, eccentricity, solidity, skewness, and kurtosis from the preprocessed image.

3. **Data Preparation:**
   - Create CSV files for training and testing data, including features and labels.

4. **Neural Network Training:**
   - Train a neural network using the extracted features as input and labels as output.

5. **Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the trained model on both training and testing datasets.

## Usage

1. **Training Data Preparation:**
   - Images of genuine and forged signatures are stored in the "real" and "forged" folders, respectively.
   - Running `makeCSV()` will create CSV files with features and labels for training and testing.

2. **Model Training and Evaluation:**
   - Run `trainAndTest()` to train and evaluate the model with specified hyperparameters.
   - The function outputs average training accuracy, testing accuracy, and time taken for evaluation.

3. **Testing a Single Image:**
   - Run `testing(path)` to create a CSV file with features for a single test image.

4. **Customization:**
   - The neural network architecture and hyperparameters can be adjusted in the code for experimentation.

5. **Note:**
   - The code uses TensorFlow v1, as indicated by `tf.compat.v1`. Consider updating to the latest TensorFlow version if necessary.

## Example Usage

```python
# Set genuine and forged image paths
genuine_image_paths = "real"
forged_image_paths = "forged"

# Create CSV files for training and testing
makeCSV()

# Provide training person's id and test image path
train_person_id = input("Enter person's id : ")
test_image_path = input("Enter path of signature image : ")

# Set paths for training and testing CSV files
train_path = 'Features/Training/training_' + train_person_id + '.csv'
testing(test_image_path)
test_path = 'TestFeatures/testcsv.csv'

# Evaluate the trained model
train_accuracy, test_accuracy, evaluation_time = trainAndTest()

print("Training Accuracy:", train_accuracy)
print("Testing Accuracy:", test_accuracy)
print("Time taken for evaluation:", evaluation_time)
```
